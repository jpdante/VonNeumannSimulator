# VonNeumannSimulator - VNS
Von Neumann machine simulator.

## About
VNS allows you to simulate Von Neumann's machine and see the CPU's processes, each step of the process is indicated by color defined by a delay, facilitating the interpretation and understanding of its operation.
Its purpose is to help in teaching how a basic CPU would work, making it possible to teach and learn the assembly programming of Von Neumann's machine.

## Why ?
I created this simulator to help in a university computing class, the existing simulators of von neumann's machine are slow, have bugs or do not help didactically.
